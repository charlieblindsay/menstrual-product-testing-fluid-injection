Changes with manufacturing:
- New bearings so height of motor and linear rods changed
- Realized that could not drill into hardened steel linear rods so decided to stick PVC blocks. 
- PVC blocks had too small a surface area to glue to the base. Hence, decided to remake them. New PVC blocks had both linear rods press fit into them with a hole in the middle for the lead screw to pass through.
- Components box: Drilled 3 holes: 1 for power supply wire, 1 for arduino input wire and 1 for the motor wires, heater wires, thermocouple wires and grounding wire to pass through. These are waterproofed using rubber grommets (for the arduino hole) and 

Issues with assembling:
- Realized that our method of
